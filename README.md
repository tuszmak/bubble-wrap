Bubble wrap is a website where you can set a width and a height for a play field, and then pop bubble wrap!


# Requirements

A package manager, like npm or yarn.

# Installation:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the packages with your favorite package manager e.g. ``npm install``
3. Start the program with either ``vite`` or using the scripts e.g ``npm run dev``

# Gameplay

The game has two modes you can pop bubbles with. 
The default is the **click** mode, where it pops a bubble when you click.
The other mode is the **hover** mode, where it works by moving the mouse over the play field.

When you want to reset the field, you can erase the current one with the ``Clear board`` button and get a new one using the same button.
